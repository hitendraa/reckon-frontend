On-Chain Project Showcasing Platform 
(MERN + Tezos) 
Overview 
This platform is a decentralized crowdfunding and recognition system where builders can mint their 
projects as NFTs and receive XTZ donations from supporters. In return, supporters receive Gratitude 
NFTs, acting as proof of support. The platform ensures legitimacy by implementing a submission fee 
and an admin review process before listing projects.
